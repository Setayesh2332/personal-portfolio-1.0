          <p>
            Hey there! I'm Seta, a curious and driven Computer Science student with a
            passion for turning ideas into reality through code. From a young age, I've
            been fascinated by how technology works and how it can solve real-world
            problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science, where I've been
            exploring everything from algorithms and data structures to web development
            and artificial intelligence.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you'll find me tinkering with new tools, brainstorming
            project ideas, or diving into tech blogs to stay updated on the latest
            trends.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm currently seeking a stage (internship) where I can apply my skills, learn
            from experienced professionals, and contribute to impactful projects. My
            goal is to grow as a developer while making a positive impact through
            technology.
          </p>
