          Iâ€™m a passionate Computer Science student with a love for problem-solving,
          coding, and building things that make a difference. Whether itâ€™s developing
          sleek web applications, diving into the world of AI, or exploring game
          development, Iâ€™m always excited to learn and create.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, Iâ€™m on the lookout for a <strong>stage (internship)</strong> where
          I can apply my skills, grow as a developer, and contribute to meaningful
          projects. If youâ€™re looking for someone whoâ€™s curious, dedicated, and always
          ready to take on a challenge â€” letâ€™s connect!
